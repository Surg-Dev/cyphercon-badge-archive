This is the custom firmware.uf2 file we used to install micropython onto the badge.

The standard Raspberry Pi version does not support the size of the eeprom we used.  So, if for what ever reason you need to reflash the badge, use this.  Note that you should probably back up the files on the badge before reflashing.
