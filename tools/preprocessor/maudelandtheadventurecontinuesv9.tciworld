.orig
You step off the ferry at Entry Point, ready to explore. One of the locals is on hand to assist new visitors. "Hello, my name is Maude, but you KNOW that because I have on MY name tag." Maude hands you a blank name tag and a marker. Maude leans against the social contract while waiting for you to finish filling out your name ... so she can get her marker back. Hint: See this highlighted $button(.entername)? It is a button. Turn the knob on the badge until the color of the lights matches the color next to the button, r for red. Press in the knob to click the red button.

.entername
Unknown to Maude, she and her marker are both imaginary. So, instead of writing on your badge ... you decide to enter your name into your badge using magical color buttons. There are six button colors: $button(.red)ed $button(.yellow)ellow $button(.green)reen $button(.teal)eal $button(.blue)lue and $button(.violet)iolet. Black is when all the lights are off, white is when all the lights are on. Black and white are not used for buttons. Selecting black will always bring you to the badge main menu. Selecting white will always put your badge into network mode. In network mode, your badge can send and receive updates with other badges.

and notice that your badge is clever enough to know what you did. You suspect this is only a glimpse of what this device can do. First things first, however: Maude is waiting for you to $button(.entertype)enter your name and she is kinda scary so ... $wset(.namebuffer|) $wset(.nameisset|no)

.newtag
With a look that could wilt tulips, Maude provides you a replacement. You suspect she may have been planning on scalping any left over paper badges. You start to $button(.entertype)enter your name again, day dreaming about Maude's life of crime. $wset(.namebuffer|) $wset(.nameisset|no)

You see the tour guide return and start running towards the balloon, yelling out "Find a visa transport node!" $button(.deltafactory1)Welp.

.deltafactory1
art: hotairballoonride2.tci Sure enough, you get what would have been a lovely view of the city with the carillon towers rising high from Mission Collective, and the telltale signs of the subway system scrawled between the major points. But you are heading up. And up. $button(.deltafactory2)Continue.

.deltafactory3
$pset(!atdeltagood|yes)The hot air balloon lands again in the middle of the shipping container yard, but you're not greeted by panicked individuals anymore. In fact, because of the MEP module, and the great pay at the Delta Factory, there's an increased workforce on the island. $wget(.includehotairballoonride) is living the dream off of the wages. Do you head to the $button(.deltafactoryfloor)Delta Factory or $button(.deltavisamep)head back to the City?

.deltavisamep
art: deltavisanode.tci You find yourself at the the visa transport node. There are multiple charging / transport platforms in a row and all powered on. A line of brand new units are seen being transported. Many older units are also in line, presumably taking money back down. $button(.deltafactoryfloor)Back to the factory or $button(.subwaymain)Back to the city!

.deltafactory4
$pset(!atdeltabad|yes)You don't quite know how much time has passed but enough that you had fallen asleep. The hot air balloon was no longer swaying as you had expected, and strangely had somehow found a place to land. It was in the middle of a shipping container yard and apparently a graveyard for other hot air balloons. This had happened before. $wget(.includedeltabad) follows everyone else coming towards you.

.theyhaveit
With the knowledge you've gotten from the shopkeeper, you realize you have the MEP module installed. You call out over the yells and say you have one! The crowd starts crying tears of happiness. "You're literally the most valuable unit on this island right now. Please, we need to get the module installed at the $button(.deltavisa)visa transport node." 

.theydonthaveit
The strange units surround you and keep yelling out "Do they have the MEP module?" You decide to stay in the basket. Someone pulls out a scanner and makes a sound of disgust. "Nope, this one's trapped just like the rest of us." A collective groan goes up, and they walk off. $wget(.includedeltabad) opens up the basket and motions you out. $button(.wtf)What is going on?

.wtf
I'm guessing you decided to take a hot air balloon ride? And the idiot tour guide "forgot to get a backup MEP module"? You nod. "Yeah, there must be some kickback to him for sending usable units up to this factory. Most of us just wanted to explore before running any jobs, and well, now we're trapped. There's no way to get down back to the city without a MEP module. And unless someone else comes up here and has a MEP module, welcome to your new home." $button(.tellmemore)Say what? $button(.deltavisa)Visa transport node? $button(.deltafactoryfloor)Factory?

.tellmemore
art: factory.tci This is Delta Factory - it's where all transport class units are made and then shipped down to Entry Point when requisitioned. Only problem is each unit has a one-time MEP module that can't be used for anyone else. The only MEP that can bring multiple units back into the city is one found down there, but finding someone who isn't trapped has been difficult. And that's the whole of this island. $button(.deltavisa)Visa transport node? $button(.deltafactoryfloor)Factory?

.deltavisalook
You see multiple units just milling around the visa transport node area in various states of distress. $wget(.includedeltabad) is on a computer at the transport area calling out about how they had just reached someone in the city and told them to bring a MEP module. $if($pget(!walkie-talkie)|yes|You remember you got a walkie-talkie at some point and call "mayday mayday"....$wget(.maudecall)|If only you had a way to communicate with the city...) $button(.deltafactoryfloor)Look around some more.

.installMEP
art: deltavisanode.tci You approach the terminal that the others have directed you to, and after carefully removing it from your body, you plug the innocuous-looking module into the visa transport node terminal. Code begins to pour out, screen after screen. Do you want to $button(.confirminstall)confirm the installation?

.confirminstall
art: deltavisanode.tci You confirm the install. $pset(!MEPinstall|yes)Units begin lining up at the transport platforms to get sent to Entry Point. You decide to do so too. You get to head back $button(.subwaymain)home!

The foreman sees you looking around. $button(.build)"Get back to work slacker!" or $button(.deltavisa)You make a quick exit.

The foreman lights up as they see you, "Great to see you return, how's the family? We've prepped your $button(.buildmep)build station just for you! Coffee's in the breakroom, Maude even brought donuts!" Or did you need some fresh air at the $button(.deltavisamep)Delta Visa node?
