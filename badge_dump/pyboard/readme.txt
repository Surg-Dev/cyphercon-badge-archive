Official way to customize your badge:

Use a tool like Thonny to upload customization files to this directory.

custom.tcisite < a custom badge web site file
custom.tcipage < a custom badge logo file

With either of these files in place, select Uploader from the System Menu on the badge to automatically upload the new custom site and/or logo into your user file.

Any other changes made to the files found on this eeprom will likely cause the badge to become non-functional.


My badge keeps changing!?:

When in Network Mode, your badge downloads information about what has been happening on all of the other badges at the conference.  Other users will show up in your adventure.  The websites that other attendees have designed will show up in your browser.  Logos which other attendees have designed will appear while idle mode is set to network collection.  This is fine :)

Note: The network is slow, so leave your badge in network as much as possible if you are around other badges.

Also: Your badge is a relay node for other people's badge data to travel across the network.  The more user files you have collected, the better of a relay your badge will be.


Here there be bugs:

While I did put as many hours into testing as I could, there are certainly bugs left lurking in this code.  If you find a bug and fix it, share the fix with others, and let me know!
